# 0802 Prototype-Based Programming- Definition
## Assignment
### Status: Final 20190501

**Instruction**
 1. Explain in your own word, what is the meaning of **Prototype-Based Programming** in JavaScript and how it is commonly utilized

**Solution**
Prototype-based programming is a style of object-oriented programming where classes are not present, and behavior reuse (or inheritance in class-based languages) is performed by cloning existing objects that serve as prototypes.

But i guess, this is hard how to track class we have built. and if you don't clear define it it would be confusing.

Note : 
Object Update
A value in an object can be updated by assignment. If the property name already exists in the object, the property value is replaced:
stooge.firstName = 'Jerome';
If the object does not already have that property name, the object is augmented:
stooge.midName = 'Budi';
