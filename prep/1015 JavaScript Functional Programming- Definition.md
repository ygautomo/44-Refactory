# 1015 JavaScript Functional Programming- Definition
## Assignment
### Status: Final 20190501

**Instruction**
 1. Explain what is the meaning of Functional Programming in JavaScript

**Solution**
In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

This means that a program becomes a sequence of expressions based on the return values of functions. The return value of a function should only depend on the values provided as arguments.

JavaScript adopt several aspects of Functional Programming, such as:

 - First class functions, which is functions are treated as objects, and could be assigned to a variable.
 - High Order Function. Functions that accept functions as arguments or return functions are called Higher Order Functions.
 - Support Declarative Pattern, such as lambda function, but in my opinion this could be confused to read such declarative code.
 - Support recursive method implementation
